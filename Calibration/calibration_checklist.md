1. Print the Checkerboard
You need a physical checkerboard pattern:
8 rows × 11 columns of squares
You can print a standard checkerboard pattern or generate one online
Make sure it's flat (mount on cardboard if needed)
2. Setup Zoom
Start a Zoom meeting (can be just yourself)
Add both cameras to the meeting
Verify Gallery View shows both cameras side-by-side evenly
Start recording the meeting
3. Record Checkerboard
Hold the checkerboard and move it around for 20 seconds:
Close to cameras (fill most of frame)
Far from cameras
Tilted left/right
Rotated at different angles
Different positions (left, right, up, down, center)
Move slowly - avoid motion blur
Keep it flat and fully visible in BOTH camera views
4. Stop Recording
Save the Zoom recording
5. Process & Calibrate
Then come back and we'll:
Split the video with FFmpeg
Run the calibration script
Validate the results
